- **Total Months**: The number of months in the dataset.
- **Total Profit/Losses**: The sum of profit/loss for all months.
- **Average Change**: The average change in profit/loss from month to month.

The project reads in a CSV file, performs the necessary calculations, and outputs both the results in the terminal and as a text file.
